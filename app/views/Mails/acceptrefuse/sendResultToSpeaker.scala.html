 <p>We're sorry to inform you that none of your proposals has been accepted for @Messages("longYearlyName").</p>
 <p>The program committee has received a lot of proposals for few slots. As you can imagine, the selection of speakers wasn’t an easy task, considering that we received more than 240 great proposals for only 24 available slots. We would like to thank you for your time, and we hope to see you as an attendee on March 3rd, at Voxxed Days Zürich.</p>
