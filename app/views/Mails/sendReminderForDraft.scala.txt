@(firstName:String, proposals:List[Proposal])

Dear @firstName

CFP will be closed on @ConferenceDescriptor.current().timing.cfpClosedOn.toString("EEEE dd/MM/YYYY HH:mm")

We'd like to inform you that you have @proposals.size proposal@if(proposals.size>1){s} with status set to "Draft" on @Messages("longName") CFP.
You must submit a talk for review on your private CFP section, so that the program committee can review and vote for your proposal.

@proposals.map{proposal=>
 - @proposal.title  [http://@ConferenceDescriptor.current().conferenceUrls.cfpHostname@routes.CallForPaper.editProposal(proposal.id)]
}

If you don't want to receive this message, you can also move the draft proposals to Trash from the home section.

Thanks!

The @Messages("longName") team
